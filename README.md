I made an animation to notify the user on low and high battery levels.

# Setup
The left part (time & date) and the right part (battery level and charging or not) are 2 separate widgets.<br>
The middle part is the Mac dock scaled to match the size of the widgets and made transparnt with [cDock](https://www.macenhance.com/cdock), but it looks good with the default dock as well.
